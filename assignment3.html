Assignment 3

	One activity I did was comparing search engines. The goal was to search for the same thing in Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. It was figuring out which one has the best user interface, and which feels to be the most useful. I would have to say that google is the best search engine to use because it gives the most results compared to any other search engine, most people use it who use computers, and overall, I think it’s the most reputable one out of the 4. Google also has 89% of the search engine market shares, making it the most dominant search engine on the web right now. I could envision applying these concepts because if I were to use google to find information for a research project at some point, I will know how to better use the search engine to help me find what I’m looking for.

	Another activity I did was using search engines using quotations. The goal was to search up the search engine market share with and without quotation marks. The idea is that you search for the exact phrase with and without quotations and see which gives you more accurate results on the search.  I found that the results were more accurate when I used the quotations because it provided a lot more information and a video, I watched from a different activity showed that quotations help with making your search more accurate to what you’re looking for. I envision to use these concepts in my current environment to help me with browsing the web and helping me find a more accurate search when I’m on the web researching something.

	The last activity I did was searching for a specific site. I used my preferred search engine (Google) to search Wikiveristy on other web browsers and compare results using the special search. I found that the special search page has the best results when I put it into the Google search engine. There was more information that came up compared to when I used the special search option on the yahoo browser and Bing browser. I can envision applying these concepts to my current and future environment because these activities give me a good reference as to knowing which search engines are the best and give the best results for what I’m looking for.
