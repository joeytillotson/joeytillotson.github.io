	<h1>Assignment 3 FINAL</h1>

	<p style="color: green; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">One activity I did was comparing search engines. The goal was to search for the same thing in Google, Bing,
		Yahoo,
		and Ask. It was figuring out which one has the best user interface, and which feels to be the most useful. I
		would
		have to say that Google is the best search engine to use because it gives the most results compared to any other
		search engine, most people use it who use computers, and overall, I think it's the most reputable one out of the
		4.
		Google also has 89% of the search engine market shares, making it the most dominant search engine on the web
		right
		now. I could envision applying these concepts because if I were to use Google to find information for a research
		project at some point, I would know how to better use the search engine to help me find what I'm looking for.
		This
		knowledge could've been useful because just recently I was gathering information for a research project and was
		trying to decide between using Google and Bing to find research. That's when I did some digging and realized
		that
		Google was the better option because the interface was user-friendly for most users compared to another search
		engines.</p>

		<p style="color: red; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">Another activity I did was using search engines using quotations. The goal was to search up the search engine
		market
		Share with and without quotation marks. The idea is that you search for the exact phrase with and without
		quotations
		and see which gives you more accurate results on the search. I found that the results were more accurate when I
		used
		the quotations because it provided a lot more information and a video, I watched from a different activity
		showed
		that quotations help with making your search more accurate to what you're looking for. I envision using these
		concepts in my current environment to help me with browsing the web and helping me find a more accurate search
		when
		Im on the web researching something. A way these skills could've been applied was the other day I was looking
		for
		facts on Mars and the solar system and could've used quotations while searching for information on Google and it
		would've given me much better results for what I was looking for.</p>

		<p style="color: blue; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">The last activity I did was searching for a specific site. I used my preferred search engine (Google) to search
		Wikiveristy on other web browsers and compare results using the special search. I found that the special search
		page
		has the best results when I put it into the Google search engine. There was more information that came up
		compared
		to when I used the special search option on the Yahoo browser and Bing browser. I can envision applying these
		concepts to my current and future environment because these activities give me a good reference for knowing
		which
		search engines are the best and give the best results for what I'm looking for. For example, I was looking for
		the
		best recipes for making cookies and was looking through results on Google and Yahoo. These skills would've most
		likely helped me find a better recipe to bake cookies if I had known more about the special search on
		wikiveristy
		when I was browsing for recipes on the web.</p>
