Assignment 5 FINAL

	One activity I did was Creating a LinkedIn account. I have known about LinkedIn for quite some time now as I do have other social media but have never personally used it myself. LinkedIn is like every other social media, but it has lots of features other social media sites do not have. For example, not only can you connect with people on the site, but you can also use it to search for jobs. I learned that you could join LinkedIn groups and add connections on LinkedIn. I envision being able to apply these concepts to my current environment because LinkedIn can be a useful tool for when I graduate high school and I’m looking for a job because LinkedIn is also used for job hunting as well as its many other features.

	Another activity I did was all about Snapchat. Snapchat is another social media app used for messaging and social networking. Snapchat stands out from other social media platforms with its picture interface, allowing users to only look at pictures once and then disappears afterwards. It’s a little bit alike from other social media platforms but snapchat allows you to send pictures AKA “snaps” to other users on the platform and with the ability to add filters also. I learned that snap chat’s way of sending “snaps” and pictures making them temporarily is what makes the app so popular today. I envision being able to apply these concepts to my current environment because I use snapchat once in while already to contact people, but this knowledge will help me make better use of the app when sending pictures and messages to people.

	The last activity I did was learning about Chrome Remote Desktop. It is a desktop software tool made by google and allows a user to control another’s desktop computer using the software. This is most used for troubleshooting issues that users may have on their computer that require the assistance of an online technician. I learned that this software used to be just a chrome extension from the chrome web store, but his has since become a desktop management software. I envision applying these concepts to my future environment because troubleshooting may be a part of my job in the future and knowing about this software and its purpose will make it useful for troubleshooting If I ever needed to.
