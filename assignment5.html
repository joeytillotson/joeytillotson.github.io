	<h1>Assignment 5 FINAL</h1>

	{p style="'color: blue; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">One activity I did was Creating a LinkedIn account. I have known about LinkedIn for quite some time now as I do
		have
		other social media but have never personally used it myself. LinkedIn is like every other social media, but it
		has
		lots of features other social media sites do not have. For example, not only can you connect with people on the
		site, but you can also use it to search for jobs. I learned that you could join LinkedIn groups and add
		connections
		on LinkedIn. I envision being able to apply these concepts to my current environment because LinkedIn can be a
		a useful tool for when I graduate high school and I'm looking for a job because LinkedIn is also used for job
		hunting
		as well as its many other features.</p>

	<p>Another activity I did was all about Snapchat. Snapchat is another social media app used for messaging and social
		networking. Snapchat stands out from other social media platforms with its picture interface, allowing users to
		only
		look at pictures once and then disappears afterward. It's a little bit like other social media platforms
		but
		Snapchat allows you to send pictures AKA “snaps” to other users on the platform and with the ability to add
		filters
		also. I learned that snap chats way of sending “snaps” and pictures making them temporarily is what makes the
		app
		so popular today. I envision being able to apply these concepts to my current environment because I use Snapchat
		once in a while already to contact people, but this knowledge will help me make better use of the app when sending
		pictures and messages to people.</p>

	<p>The last activity I did was learning about Chrome Remote Desktop. It is a desktop software tool made by Google
		and
		allows a user to control another desktop computer using the software. This is most used for troubleshooting
		issues
		that users may have on their computers that require the assistance of an online technician. I learned that this
		software used to be just a Chrome extension from the Chrome web store, but this has since become a desktop
		management
		software. I envision applying these concepts to my future environment because troubleshooting may be a part of
		my
		job in the future and knowing about this software and its purpose will make it useful for troubleshooting If I
		ever
		needed to.</p>
