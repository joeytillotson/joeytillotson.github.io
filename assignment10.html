<p>After doing the activities with CSS, I learned that it relates to HTML coding in many ways. It uses both body and paragraph tags in the coding language, like HTML. The 4 style sheets are what makeup CSS with HTML coding. Inline, Embedded, External, and imported style sheets are what makeup CSS. I also learned that the rule in CSS is Selector, property, then values. I envision applying these concepts to my future environment because sometime in the future I will use these skills on the computer as part of a project. Whether it be an ad for a product, commercial ads, or creating websites these are all things that will come in handy when learning about CSS with HTML coding.</p>
