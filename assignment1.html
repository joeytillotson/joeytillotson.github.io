Assignment 1

One activity I did was Understanding Computers: Understanding Applications. In this activity I learned about all the different applications used on desktops and computers and learned the purposes they all serve on the computer and as part of their interface. For example, I learned that Microsoft Word is a desktop application that allows you to write letters and create documents. Another one I learned about was web browsers. Web browsers are important for the computer and its good to know their purpose because they are very important to how a computer functions and assisting the user. These types of desktop applications allow the user to search the web for ANYTHING they may need to know about, whether its to solve a certain problem or get more insight about something you would want to know more about. Lastly, I learned about media players. These are desktop applications that are used for listening to files and zipped files on a computer. Its also commonly used by users to listen to music. The way I envision to apply these concepts is simply as something to look back on if I ever use these desktop apps and run into some issues while using them, I’ll know what the issue is and how to solve them because of how much I will know about them from what I’ve learned.

Another activity I learned about was Internet connectivity. Here, I learned about all the different types of internet connections and how they all correlate in their own way and the good and bad of it all. To start, I learned the 6 different connection types: Dial up, ISDN, DSL, Cable TV, Satellite, and wireless. With that knowledge, I learned that dial up internet connection is the least effective connection to use while fiber and DSL/broadband connections are faster and much more efficient for users to have. I envision applying these concepts to my everyday life because when the time comes for me to buy internet for my house in the future or something like that, ill have a better understanding of what internet connection is the most efficient, reliable, and affordable for me. It will also help me just understand how all these connections are different and what sets them apart from each other.

The last activity I completed was Downloading and Uploading Files. Here, I learned all about downloading and uploading files and how they are different and the purposes they serve on the computer. For example, I learned today that downloading something is putting something from a website or elsewhere and putting it on your computer, while uploading is taking something from your computer and sending it out somewhere like a website or cloud storage. To give an example, uploading an important work file to the cloud from your computer so it is never at risk of being deleted or going missing on the desktop as it is backed up to the cloud storage. I envision using these concepts in my everyday life because I will from now on upload all my important files to the cloud storage, along with just having them on my computer so im never at risk of ever losing them.
