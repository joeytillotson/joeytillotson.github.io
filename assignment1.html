    <h1>Assignment 1 FINAL</h1>

    <p style="color: red; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">One activity I did was Understanding Computers: Understanding Applications. In this activity I learned about all
        the
        different applications used on desktops and computers and learned the purposes they all serve on the computer
        and as
        part of their interface. For example, I have been using Microsoft Word to write letters and create documents.
        Another thing that I learned about was web browsers. Web browsers are important for the computer and it's good to
        know their purpose because they are especially important to how a computer functions and assists the user. The
        most
        common web browsers that I currently use on my computer are Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. These types of desktop
        applications allow the user to search the web for ANYTHING they may need to know about, whether it's to solve a
        certain problem or get more insight about something you would want to know more about. Lastly, I got more
        insight
        into media players and how they function on a computer. Most of us use these in our everyday lives such as
        Spotify,
        YouTube, etc. I use both Spotify and YouTube about every day to watch videos and listen to music in my free
        time.
        They are desktop applications that are used for listening to files and zipped files on a computer. Its also
        commonly
        used by users to listen to music. The way I envision applying these concepts is simply as something to look back
        on
        if I ever use these desktop apps and run into some issues while using them, I will know what the issue is and
        how to
        solve them because of how much I will know about them from what I have learned.</p>

        <p style="color: blueviolet; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">Another activity I did was about Internet connectivity. Here, I learned about all the several types of internet
        connections and how they all correlate in their own way, and the good and bad of it all. To start, I learned the
        six
        different connection types: Dial-up, ISDN, DSL, Cable TV, Satellite, and wireless. Personally, the internet
        connection used in our household is a wired/broadband connection. If I had the opportunity, I would switch to a
        fiber connection as everyone in my household uses the internet for lots of different things, and a faster
        connection
        is always good to have. Unfortunately, due to where we reside, we do not qualify to get a fiber internet
        connection.
        With that knowledge, I learned that dial up internet connection is the least effective connection to use while
        fiber
        and DSL/broadband connections are faster and much more efficient for users to have. I envision applying these
        concepts to my everyday life because when the time comes for me to buy internet for my house in the future or
        something like that, ill have a better understanding of what internet connection is the most efficient,
        dependable,
        and affordable for me. It will also help me just understand how all these connections are different and what
        sets
        them apart from each other.</p>

        <p style="color: red; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">The last activity I completed was Downloading and Uploading Files. Here, I gained more knowledge about
        downloading and
        uploading files and how they are different and the purposes they serve on the computer. For example, I learned
        more
        about how downloading something is putting something from a website or elsewhere and putting it on your
        computer, while
        uploading is taking something from your computer and sending it out somewhere like a website or cloud storage.
        To give
        an example, I use both Google Drive and Azure for cloud storage and backing up data, which I have been using for
        the
        last 3 years now. I envision using these concepts in my everyday life because I will from now on upload all my
        important
        files to the cloud storage, along with just having them on my computer so I am never at risk of ever losing
        them.</p>
