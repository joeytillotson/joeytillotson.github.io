	<h1>Assignment 6 FINAL</h1>

	{p style="'color: pink; text-align: left; font-size: 18pt">One activity I did was Job searching and Networking. In today's day and age, job searching is very easy. You can
		do
		it online, on social media, and through direct contact with employers. You can also use a job search engine such as
		Indeed
		or SimplyHired to find a job. Another way is opting for job alert postings. When you do this, you'll receive
		notifications every time a job opens in a specific position or place you are looking for. I learned that there
		are
		job postings that get posted online every day and most jobs don't require any college education other than
		previous
		work experience, depending on where you look to work at. I envision using these concepts in my current
		environment
		because I recently started a new job back in November of last year. Ironically enough, I used indeed to find the
		job
		and I opted in for job postings and made finding a job so much easier for me than ever before.</p>

	<p>Another activity I did was Career planning and Salary. It's important to plan your career and how you plan to make
		money for the rest of your life. Planning your future financially is essential to your life and how you want to
		live.
		Many people like us have certain needs and requirements for our careers such as a college degree. I learned that
		many people have found many easy ways to help discover and assess their career needs to build their career. I
		envision using these concepts in my future environment because when the time comes, I'm going to need to know
		how to
		assess my career and find what will be the best path for starting my career, and learning from this activity how
		to
		do that will make building my career easier.</p>

	<p>The last activity I did was creating a LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn is a career focusing on social media to help users
		better their careers. Many employers and other places of work use LinkedIn to interview and hire new and
		potential
		employees. It has many good features on it to help with finding jobs, including an online resume builder which
		can
		be used to make a resume electronically and allows you to send it to employers when you look to apply for jobs. I
		envision using these concepts in my future environment because this will be a good way for me to start looking
		for
		jobs online and with my knowledge from this activity, I'll have a very good idea of how to use LinkedIn to do so
		which will make job hunting much easier than before.</p>
