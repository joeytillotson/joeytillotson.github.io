Assignment 6 FINAL

	One activity I did was Job searching and Networking. In today’s day and age, job searching is very easy. You can do it online, on social media, and direct contact from employers. You can also use a job search engine such as Indeed or SimplyHired to find a job. Another way is opting for job alert postings. When you do this, you’ll receive notifications every time a job opens in a specific position or place you are looking for. I learned that there are job postings that get posted online every day and most jobs don’t require any college education other than previous work experience, depending on where you look to work at. I envision using these concepts in my current environment because I recently started a new job back in November of last year. Ironically enough, I used indeed to find the job and I opted in for job postings and made finding a job so much easier for me than ever before.

	Another activity I did was Career planning and Salary. Its important to plan your career and how you plan to make money the rest of your life. Planning your future financially is essential to your life and how you want to live. Many people like us have certain needs and requirements for our careers such as a college degree. I learned that many people have found many easy ways to help discover and assess their career needs to build their career. I envision using these concepts in my future environment because when the time comes, I’m going to need to know how to assess my career and find what will be the best path for starting my career, and learning from this activity how to do that will make building my career easier.

	The last activity I did was creating a LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn is a career focusing social media to help users better their careers. Many employers and other places of work use LinkedIn to interview and hire new and potential employees. It has many good features on it to help with finding jobs, including an online resume builder which can be used to make a resume electronically and allows you to send to employers when you look to apply for jobs. I envision using these concepts in my future environment because this will be a good way for me to start looking for jobs online and with my knowledge from this activity, I’ll have a very good idea of how to use LinkedIn to do so which will make job hunting much easier than before.
