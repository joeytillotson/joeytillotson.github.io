	<h1>Assignment 9 FINAL</h1>

	{p style="'color: cyan; text-align: right; font-size: 18pt"}I learned many things in these HTML activities from what
	I already knew. For example, I learned that HTML has
	an element
	tags and attributes tags. I didn't know either of these tags was a thing in HTML code until now when I did
	these
	activities. I also learned that almost all websites use HTML coding to create the site along with more types of code.
	I
	envision being able to apply these concepts to my future environment because I already have lots of knowledge on
	HTML and creating websites and these skills will help me to make my own website someday.</p>
