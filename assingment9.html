Assignment 9 FINAL

	I learned many things in these HTML activities from what I already knew. For example, I learned that HTML has element tags and attributes tags. I didnâ€™t know either of these tags were a thing in HTML code until now when I did these activities. I also learned that mostly all websites use HTML coding to create the site along more types of code. I envision being able to apply these concepts to my future environment because I already have lots of knowledge on HTML and creating websites and these skills will help me to make my own website someday.
