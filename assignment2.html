Assignment 2

	One activity I did was all about web browsers. All web browsers are used to let users view and explore information across the web. Web browsers are used in lots of people’s everyday lives. I learned that web browsers are built up of many components but the main 3 that make it all function properly are called the Controller/Dispatcher, Interpreter, and the Client Programs. The controller takes the input from the mouse and keyboard and displays it onto the screen, which is how you can move a cursor and type words. An interpreter uses optional JAVA commands to suggest things that the user may be trying to do. Lastly, the client program gives command of the system which allows it to do a specific service. Whether it be building a website with picture pop up commands or something else like that, Client programs are very important for computers and are very common in lots of things on the internet. I apply these concepts to my environment and everyday because I use web browsers for all types of things on both my phone and computer every single day whether I’m looking something up or trying to get onto a certain website.


	Another activity I did was about browser extensions and how they are used on the internet. Web extensions all have different purposes as they are all different and serve different purposes supporting the browser. For example, Adobe flash is a plug-in used on a browser, but it is like a browser extension used for launching things on the computer such as web apps, mobile apps, etc. Honor lock is a common one used here at Harper College for asynchronous classes when taking tests to prevent academic dishonesty and recorded sessions during the test, so nobody has an unfair advantage on a test that isn’t fair to others.  Another plugin that many users must use to prevent viruses and make web browsing much more convenient is AdBlock which blocks known and unknown websites to send ads to your computer screen. I could apply these concepts to my everyday life because web extensions are most used if you are creating a website, or you are trying to run something on your computer that requires a specific plugin for it to work correctly.


	The last activity I did was all about Microsoft Edge. I learned the shortcuts used in the browser and how it’s one of the fastest and most reliable web browsers known to date. I also learned it was one of the few browsers that supports the google chromium code and supports windows 11. I could apply this concept when I’m using edge because I’ll have a better understanding of how to use the shortcuts and how to use windows 11 as Microsoft edge supports it.
