	<h1>Assignment 2 FINAL</h1>

	<p style="color: blue; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">One activity I did was all about web browsers. All web browsers are used to let users view and explore
		information
		across the web. Web browsers are used in lots of people's everyday lives. I learned that web browsers are built
		up
		of many components but the main 3 that make it all function properly are called the Controller/Dispatcher,
		Interpreter, and the Client Programs. The controller takes the input from the mouse and keyboard and displays it
		onto the screen, which is how you can move a cursor and type words. An interpreter uses optional JAVA commands
		to
		suggest things that the user may be trying to do. Lastly, the client program gives command of the system which
		allows it to do a specific service. Whether it be building a website with picture pop-up commands or something
		else
		like that, Client programs are very important for computers and are very common in lots of things on the
		Internet. I
		apply these concepts to my environment and every day because I use web browsers for all types of things on both
		my
		phone and computer every single day whether I'm looking something up or trying to get onto a certain website.
	</p>

	<p style="color: red; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">Another activity I did was about browser extensions and how they are used on the internet. Web extensions all
		have
		different purposes as they are all different and serve different purposes supporting the browser. For example,
		Adobe
		Flash is a plug-in used on a browser, but it is like a browser extension used for launching things on the
		computer
		such as web apps, mobile apps, etc. Honor lock is a common one used here at Harper College for asynchronous
		classes
		when taking tests to prevent academic dishonesty and recorded sessions during the test, so nobody has an unfair
		advantage on a test that isn't fair to others. Another plugin that many users must use to prevent viruses and
		make
		web browsing is much more convenient is AdBlock which blocks known and unknown websites to send ads to your
		computer
		screen. I could apply these concepts to my everyday life because web extensions are mostly used if you are
		creating a
		website, or you are trying to run something on your computer that requires a specific plugin for it to work
		correctly.</p>

		<p style="color: green; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">The last activity I did was all about Microsoft Edge. I learned the shortcuts used in the browser and how its
		one
		of the fastest and most reliable web browsers known to date. I also learned it was one of the few browsers that
		supports the Google Chromium code and supports Windows 11. I could apply this concept when Im using edge
		because
		I'll have a better understanding of how to use the shortcuts and how to use Windows 11 as Microsoft Edge
		supports
		it.</p>
