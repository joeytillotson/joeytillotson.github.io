    <h1>Assignment 11 FINAL</h1>

    <p style="color: blue; text-align: left; font-size: 18pt;">In this lesson, I learned more about computer graphics and how pictures are generated. Graphics are core
        technology in digital photography, film, computer displays, etc. Most specialized hardware and software
        developed and displayed with the help of computer graphics hardware. The whole idea of computer graphics was for
        displaying art and image data to the consumer. Computer graphics are also used for processing image data that is
        taken from the physical world like photo and video content. Computer graphics have had a very strong impact on
        animations, movies, video games, ads, etc. Computer graphics is most referred to as technology used to create
        images.</p>
