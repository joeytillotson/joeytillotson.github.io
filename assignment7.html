	<h1>Assignment 7 FINAL</h1>

	<p>The first activity I did was all about Internet Reference Models. An OSI is an open system interface that is
		broken
		down into 7 layers. Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. Each layer
		functions differently to make the system interface possible. Personally, looking at all these different layers I
		think the Network and Presentation layers are the most important. I envision applying these concepts to my
		current
		environment because the OSI model is something that most people in the IT field should know about.</p>

	<p>The second activity I did was Internet Domain Name System. When there were increases in number of hosts
		Internet,
		they invented DNS systems to help put host names to an address. An IP address is a logical address given to a
		machine over the network and contains a network component and host component and each number is represented from
		0
		to 255. I learned that there are 2 different types of URLs, Absolute and Relative. I envision applying these
		concepts to my current environment to help me get a better understanding of DNS systems and IP addresses and the
		purposes they serve for machines and computers.</p>

	<p>The last activity I did was Internet protocols. In this activity, I got more insight into TCP protocols and what
		they
		offer. Such things as Stream Data Transfers, Flow Control, Full-duplex operation, Multiplexing, etc. As far as
		the
		application layer, TCP is also able to send and receive buffers and has a Connected Oriented service. I learned
		that
		the Internet protocol must be paired with a reliable protocol such as TCP at the transport layer to be reliable to
		the
		source. I envision applying these concepts to my future environment because the TCP protocol is a very useful
		tool
		to know about and has lots of good features.</p>
