Assignment 7 FINAL

	The first activity I did was all about Internet Reference Models. An OSI is an open system interface that is broken down into 7 layers. Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. Each layer functions differently to make the system interface possible. Personally, looking at all these different layers I think the Network and Presentation layers are the most important. I envision applying these concepts to my current environment because the OSI model is something that most people in the IT field should know about.

	The second activity I did was Internet Domain Name System. When there were increases in numbers of hosts internet, they invented DNS systems to help put host names to an address. An IP address is a logical address given to a machine over the network and contains a network component and host component and each number is represented from 0 to 255. I learned that there are 2 different types of URLâ€™S, Absolute and Relative. I envision applying these concepts to my current environment to help me get a better understanding of DNS systems and IP addresses and the purposes they serve for machines and computers.

	The last activity I did was Internet protocols. In this activity I got more insight on TCP protocols and what they offer. Such things as Stream Data Transfers, Flow Control, Full-duplex operation, Multiplexing, etc. As far as the application layer, TCP is also able to send and receive buffers and has a Connected Oriented service. I learned that the Internet protocol must be paired with reliable protocol such as TCP at the transport layer to be reliable to the source. I envision applying these concepts to my future environment because the TCP protocol is a very useful tool to know about and has lots of good features.
