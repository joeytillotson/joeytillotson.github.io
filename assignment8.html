	<h1>Assignment 8 FINAL</h1>

	<p>The first activity I did was about internet safety and how to be safe when browsing the web. There really isn't a
		limit to what you can do/find online. Browsing the web safely means being aware of internet risks such as
		malware,
		phishing, and spam. Being safe on the internet means knowing how to identify them and how you can avoid them.
		For
	 example, when I first bought my computer I downloaded the antivirus application MacAfee, to help keep my
		computer
		free of spyware, malware, and viruses. Even in my everyday life when I browse the internet, I see lots of things
		online that are misleading in attempts for users to click on them, which results in the user's computer to
		download
		a virus of some sort onto their computer, decreasing the performance of their computer overall. I envision
		applying
		these concepts to my current and future environment by making sure any device I have has an antivirus
		application
		installed to help me stay virus free and know the ways to identify these forms of viruses and malware.</p>

	<p>The second activity I did was all about Google privacy settings. Part of browsing the internet is knowing the
		privacy you should be allowing yourself to have on the web so your information will be confidential to you.
		Examples
		of knowing privacy options including clearing browser history, location permissions, safe browsing the web,
		sites
		that are allowed to check payment methods, etc. Even when I use my computer, I'm making sure that only certain
		sites
		are allowed access to my location and make sure only sites that are necessary to have payment methods have
		those
		permissions of accessing them. I envision applying these concepts to my current and future environment because
		its
		important to know how to always protect your privacy when browsing the web.</p>

	<p>The final activity I did was security and privacy settings for Internet Explorer. Some privacy settings used on
		internet explorer is cookies, Do Not Track settings, pop-up blockers, tracking protection, etc. You can also
		change
		security zone settings to customize how your PC is protected from harmful or malicious content on the web. I
		occasionally use internet explorer to browse the web and do certain things and I know that its safe for me to
		use
		internet explorer because they have lots of privacy settings accessible to users to help them browse securely
		and
		safely.</p>
