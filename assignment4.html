Assignment 4 FINAL
	
	The first assignment I did was about sending E-mails using Gmail. Sending emails has revolutionized the way we communicate with one another. Knowing all the components of building a computer is very important, such as recipients email addresses, subject, body, signature, etc. Attachments can be added to an email if you were to try and send some sort of documents. I surprisingly just learned recently how to add a signature in settings to sign an email. I envision applying these concepts to my current environment because I am a manager at my current workplace where I am required to use the computer a lot throughout the day and knowing all these things about sending emails will help make my E-mails that I send look more detailed and formal from now on.

	The next activity I did was E-mail spoofing. E-mail spoofing is very common in the internet world and is described as sending an email to a user with a forged email address. It is used to send spam emails to users to mislead them, which usually results in malware being installed on the users computer. I learned that as much as lots of sites are trying to find ways to eliminate email spoofing, not all websites have a built-In authentication system to detect these emails. Typically, spoofed emails like this are sent to individuals and businesses to make the user suffer financial losses. I could envision applying these concepts to my current environment because I currently receive lots of these types of emails in my personal Gmail account and have recently started using anti-malware and antivirus apps on my computer to help detect spoofed emails and malware from getting onto my computer.

	The last activity I did was learning all about Mozilla Firebird. It is an email client operated by the Mozilla foundation. Mozilla thunderbird is very similar to Gmail or Yahoo but has lots more included features. I learned that a few of the many features Mozilla Thunderbird offers is message and junk filtering, big file linking for sending large files over email, cross platform support, etc. I envision using these concepts in my current environment because sending emails using Mozilla Thunderbird makes sending emails with all these features that other email clients do not offer such as big file linking for whenever I need to send a user a large file for reviewing.
