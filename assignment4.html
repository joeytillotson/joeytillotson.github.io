	<h1>Assignment 4 FINAL</h1>

	<p style="'color: purple; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">The first assignment I did was about sending E-mails using Gmail. Sending emails has revolutionized the way we
		communicate with one another. Knowing all the components of building a computer is very important, such as
		recipients' email addresses, subject, body, signature, etc. Attachments can be added to an email if you were to
		try
		and send some sort of documents. I surprisingly just learned recently how to add a signature in settings to sign
		an
		email. I envision applying these concepts to my current environment because I am a manager at my current
		workplace
		where I am required to use the computer a lot throughout the day and knowing all these things about sending
		emails
		will help make the E-mails that I send look more detailed and formal from now on.</p>

	<p style="'color: black; text-align: left; font-size: 12pt;">The next activity I did was E-mail spoofing. E-mail spoofing is very common in the internet world and is
		described
		as sending an email to a user with a forged email address. It is used to send spam emails to users to mislead
		them,
		which usually results in malware being installed on the user's computer. I learned that as much as lots of sites
		are
		trying to find ways to eliminate email spoofing, not all websites have a built-In authentication system to
		detect
		these emails. Typically, spoofed emails like this are sent to individuals and businesses to make the user suffer
		financial losses. I could envision applying these concepts to my current environment because I currently receive
		lots of these types of emails in my personal Gmail account and have recently started using anti-malware and
		antivirus apps on my computer to help detect spoofed emails and malware from getting onto my computer.</p>

	<p>The last activity I did was learning all about Mozilla Firebird. It is an email client operated by the Mozilla
		foundation. Mozilla Thunderbird is very similar to Gmail or Yahoo but has lots more included features. I learned
		that a few of the many features Mozilla Thunderbird offers is the message and junk filtering, big file linking for
		sending large files over email, cross-platform support, etc. I envision using these concepts in my current
		environment because sending emails using Mozilla Thunderbird makes sending emails with all these features that
		other
		email clients do not offer such big file linking whenever I need to send a user a large file for
		reviewing.</p>
